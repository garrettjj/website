I know it's been a bit dead over on this side in spite of repeatedly saying that I was going to begin posting on here a bit more. In order to explain this, I wanted to give a bit of an update on where I've been and what's been tying me up. Selfishly, this will also be in order to finally get a blog post up that hopefully sets a framework for going forward. For the past two or three months, I've been largely wrapped up in some graduate studies as part of the cybersecurity program at Wilmington University. While these two classes were the start and were a bit low-level, covering securing networks and operating systems respectively, I learned a bit about how my workflow had to change going into graduate studies. Graduate studies are a lot more work! Trying to tie together an in-depth presentation on different network standards while also preparing research on impactful cyber threats in the world takes a lot out of you. It certainly didn't help that during this time I was switching careers as well!

The timing was impeccable and the transition was certainly stressful although it was well worth it. As of now, I'm working as a Developer Support Engineer at DigitalOcean. What that means is that I am now responsible for helping developers troubleshoot different issues with their infrastructure on DigitalOcean. That's a pretty wide gulf of issues that fall in there although it's certainly something that's exciting to tackle, giving a great breadth of knowledge to grapple. So far, the environment has been wonderfully positive and very rewarding. I'm sure that the journey will continue to be exciting and I look forward to sharing more about that with you guys as I push ahead in graduate studies and work. Coming up next, a walkthrough of my migration from older cloud hosting on a different provider over to the Great Blue! Let's go, Sammy!
